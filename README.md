Easy to use, simple modification.
Take a sapling, combine it with shears in the crafting grid and get a bonsai.
The Shears take 1 durability damage when used for crafting a bonsai.
Bonsais can be placed on any block as decoration and will not grow into trees.
When placed in a Garden Cloche, Bonsais will produce 4 logs of their respective woodtype.
Certain bonsai will produce extra drops like apples (from oak) or cocoa beans (from jungle).
With Farmer's Delight installed, these bonsai will also grow on Rich Soil, within the Garden Cloche.
